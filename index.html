    <p class="large-text">Covid-19 has significantly impacted our lives. The effects it had on us a few years ago continue to reverberate to this day. Various countries have found themselves in distinct positions, enabling them to support their populations in unique ways. The level of development in these nations plays a pivotal role in determining the extent of support they can provide to their citizens.

        The level of support a country can offer to its citizens during a crisis often depends on its level of development. 
        The Gini Index serves as a valuable metric for illustrating wealth inequality within a country's population. 
        Countries with higher Gini coefficients tend to face challenges in delivering effective support during critical times.

        Different countries fall under different HDI groups regions. A "high HDI group" typically includes countries with HDI values that are 
        among the highest in the world. These countries tend to have longer life expectancies, higher levels of education, and higher incomes on a
         per capita basis. <br> <br>
         This is used to show how different countries were able to face this crisis differently.
